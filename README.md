# 2D fill plots in Python
This repository contains basic examples of plots in which certain areas are filled in.

## Exercises

1. Create a new plot where the area between sin(x) and cos(x) is filled. Use values in the range from -8pi to 8pi.

2. Create a new plot where the area between the x-axis and sin(x) is filled in red, the area between sin(x) and sin(2x) is filled in blue, and the area between sin(2x) and sin(3x) is filled in green.
